Here are 5 example molecules to show how we processed the initial ZINDO calculations 
and performed the wavefunction analysis. This contains the Gaussian-16 ZINDO .log 
TDDFT .log, .fchks, and multi-wavefunction calculation .out files for each molecule. 

To recreate the .out files, just do "bash exec-mwfn.sh".
You MUST have Multiwfn installed.
All ZINDO LOG and FCHK files must be in the same DIR as the script.
